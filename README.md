# The-Inacuracies-in-Project-Hail-Mary
"Tearing apart" my favourite book of all time, but in a good way :)

100% researched, written (other than the summary), and programmed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by myself. 

I can not guarantee that everything is 100% accurate, but I hope you have fun reading it. I tried to imbed some of my personality into the writing without compromising the formality you would expect from a blog. 

The live website can be found at https://jli314.github.io/The-Inacuracies-in-Project-Hail-Mary/ if you don't feel like running my code yourself.

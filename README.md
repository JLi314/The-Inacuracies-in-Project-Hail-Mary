"Tearing apart" my favourite book of all time, but in a good way :)

100% researched and programmed by myself. I can not guarantee that everything is 100% accurate, but I hope you have fun reading it. I tried to imbed some of my personality into the writing without compromising the formality you would expect from a blog.

    <h1 class = "title">The Scientific Inacuracies in Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir</h1>
    <img src="Project Hail Mary Cover.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="450" class="bookCover">
    <p class = "intro">I would like to start this off by saying, out of the 250+ books I've logged on Goodreads over these past few years,<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary" style="color: inherit;"target="_blank">Project Hail Mary</a>, by Andy Weir, is the one the most memorable one, and my absolute all time favourite. The only other possible contender to this position would be Weir's 2015 bestseller, <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian style="color: inherit;"target="_blank">The Martian</a>. What makes this book so wonderfully captivating was all the exhilarating plot twists and genius strokes of engineering "magic". It's the perfect balance of whimsical imagination and realism, enough to make you feel as though you are being transported to another world, yet still firmly attatched to the one we are aquainted with.</p>
    <P class = "intro">Similar to The Martian, though this fictional novel is one of the most scientifically accurate ones out there, it is not completely accurate. As a result, after I finished reading the book, I sat for a while and pondered about the little scientific inaccuracies one could occasionally find throughout the novel if they searched hard enough. Since there weren't many in the ~500 page book, it became a sort of fun little treasure hunt. Using the both my preexisting knowledge, and admittedly, the internet, I have gathered a list of the few most prominent ones. </P>
    <p class = "intro">But before I get a little too ahead of myself, let me give you a short summary of Project Hail Mary to rejog your memory (assuming you've read this book before). ***Spoiler Alert*** for those who have not read this book yet, proceed with caution!</p>

    <p class = "intro">I would like to start this off by saying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary" style="color: inherit;"target="_blank">Project Hail Mary</a>, by Andy Weir is my absolute all time favourite book. The only other possible contender to this position would be Weir's 2015 bestseller, <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian style="color: inherit;"target="_blank">The Martian</a>. </p>
